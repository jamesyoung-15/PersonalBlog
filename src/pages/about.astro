    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hey! My name is James and I'm a tech enthusiast that loves to build and tinker with 
        Linux, home server (homelab), cloud services, building PCs, gaming, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am currently a student pursing a master's degree in Computer Science in BU 
        with a undergraduate degree in Electronic Engineering at HKUST.

    <h2>About My Blog Posts</h2>
    <p>
        These blog posts are mainly for myself, where I mainly document my experience
        with building hobby projects, things I learnt, and other random tidbits 
        I find interesting.
